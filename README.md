# 👋 Hey there! I'm Fernando Albino

I’m a **Systems Analysis and Development** graduate passionate about technology, automation, and infrastructure.  
My work blends **full-stack development**, **network engineering**, and **system optimization** — always driven by clarity, performance, and reliability.

I enjoy understanding how things work from the ground up — from software architecture to packet flows across networks — and turning that knowledge into efficient, secure, and elegant solutions.

## 💼 What I Do

- **Development:** modern web applications, APIs, and automation tools.  
- **Infrastructure:** managing **Docker**, **Proxmox**, **OpenWrt**, **AdGuard Home**, and **Unbound** environments.  
- **DevOps & Networking:** container orchestration, service integration, and cloud connectivity.  
- **Privacy & Performance:** DNS security, VLAN segmentation, and intelligent traffic monitoring.

## 🧠 Technical Focus

- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, PHP, C/C++, HTML, CSS  
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express, FastAPI  
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite  
- **Systems:** OpenWrt, Docker, LXC, Proxmox, Cloudflare Tunnel  
- **Other Skills:** Git, Linux, Shell scripting, DNSSEC, VPNs, network security

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Exploring

- Advanced DNS architecture combining recursive validation, encrypted transport, and network-wide content filtering.
- Network automation and containerized environments with **Linux + OpenWrt + Proxmox**.  
- Cross-platform app development using **TypeScript full-stack**.  
- Real-time monitoring and dashboards focused on performance and energy efficiency.

## 🧩 Personal Philosophy

> “Understanding technology deeply is the first step toward building something truly reliable.”

I believe in **open knowledge**, **clear documentation**, and **building tools that simplify life**.  
I like to test, break, rebuild, and refine until everything feels balanced — efficient, stable, and elegant.
